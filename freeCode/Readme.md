# Lessons

A **literal** is a value that has been hard-coded directly into your source.
C# uses PEMDAS as the order of operations.

**Instance Methods** are also called **Stateful methods** : They are built in such a way that they rely on values stored in memory by previous lines of code that have already been executed.

**Static Mehods** are also called **Stateless methods** : They don't rely on any values stored in memory.

`Overloaded Methods provide different ways to call the method or provide different types of data.`
