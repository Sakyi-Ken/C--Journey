# Lessons

A **literal** is a value that has been hard-coded directly into your source.
C# uses PEMDAS as the order of operations.

**Instance Methods** are also called **Stateful methods** : They are built in such a way that they rely on values stored in memory by previous lines of code that have already been executed.

**Static Mehods** are also called **Stateless methods** : They don't rely on any values stored in memory.

**An Overloaded Method** is defined with multiple method signatures.
`Overloaded Methods provide different ways to call the method or provide different types of data.`
_In some other cases, the overloaded method takes different number of parameters_

**The .NET Class Library** is a collection of thousands of classes containing tens of thousands of methods

`Random dice = new Random();`
The **_new_** operator does several important things:

- It first requests an address in the computer's memory large enough to store a new object based on the Random class.
- It creates the new object, and stores it at the memory address.
- It returns the memory address so that it can be saved in the dice object.

Developers refer to the code that implements different execution paths as _code branches._

An **array**is a collection of individual data elements accessible through a single variable name.
An **array** is a special type of variable that can hold multiple values of the same data type.
